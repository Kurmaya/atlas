      <h2>What is Chiropractic?</h2>
      <p>Imagine you have been suffering from back pain for as long as you can remember. You’ve tried resting it out, pain medications, even looked up some YouTube videos on yoga stretches and practiced them. But when you wake up, there it is. It puts a certain damper on your lifestyle, doesn’t it?<br>
        <br>
        If you’re tired of the “traditional” routes of improving your health, Chiropractic is for you. Chiropractic is simple. After a thorough examination of your health, including your history, your movement patterns, and the areas that are painful, a Chiropractor will use their hands to assess your spine. Using a quick, short thrust, they can eliminate areas of your spine that aren’t moving so well, and get your nervous system functioning better. The spine is a sensitive piece of your body, and a Chiropractor is expertly trained at handling any issues arising from there.<br>
        <br>
        Because our nervous system is so important to our health, visiting a Chiropractor is a great option for people with pain and without. Think of your body as a messy closet. A Chiropractor can organize your closet, allowing you to have complete ease of access to all parts, including the stuff way inside. Of course, there are more areas a Chiropractor can help. We’re trained just like Medical Doctors (MD/MBBS), only with less emphasis on prescribing medicines and more interested in the function of the human body. In fact, we have over 200 techniques that we can be trained in!<br>
        <br>
        Without the use of medicines with harmful side effects, risky surgeries, and invasive injections, we’re confident we can help you #HealBetter.</p>
      <h2>How does Chiropractic help?</h2>
      <p>The reason many methods fail to bring relief is because they are aimed at fixing the symptom. Think about it – you have a headache, you swallow a pain killer, and the headache goes away. Right? If you’re like most people, the headache just returns after the effect of the pain killer wears off. This is the most important way that Chiropractic helps - we aim for the root of the problem, not just the symptoms. If the source of the headache is taken care of, not only do you feel better at that moment, but we also teach you how to prevent it from happening again.</p>
      <h2>When should you see a chiropractor?</h2>
      <p>If you have a computer, then you know the hassle of that fateful moment when the system becomes extremely slow. Through daily usage, the addition and removal of dozens of files and programs, and general wear and tear, it starts to lag and things don’t run as smoothly.<br>
        <br>
        Our spine is a lot like this. Even with regular exercise and attention to posture, your spine can still get stuck in certain areas, leading to pain, stiffness, and restricted movement. If you’re currently having issues like this, or perhaps you wish to prevent them, both are equally good times to visit a Chiropractor.<br>
        <br>
        As Benjamin Franklin once said, “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”</p>

        Precautions to follow with ongoing chiropractic treatment

        "There are three major precautions to follow when taking a treatment plan from a chiropractor. The first precaution is to make time for healing. Injuries and pain are never convenient, and most of the time, they don’t disappear on their own. In order to heal well, you need a good combination of rest, treatment, and good nutrition. If you are always stressed because of work deadlines, not eating well, and not getting adequate sleep, your healing time will definitely be longer than you expect. The second precaution is pay attention to your posture. Thousands of regular visits to the doctor for back pain and neck pain can be avoided if we were to sit less, walk more, and spend less time on our phones or tablets. This is difficult to create as a habit, but it will ultimately save your spine in the long run. The third precaution is follow the prescription. If you have a cold or the flu, and you visit a medical doctor, he or she will prescribe a medication to be taken once or twice a day for 7-10 days, which 90% of people follow religiously. So, if the chiropractor asks you to perform a set of exercises daily, you should be performing those daily. Similarly, if the requirement is to visit the clinic twice a week for adjustments, we should attempt to prioritize those sessions, because the body heals in a pattern."

        "Chiropractic care is absolutely appropriate for children. The delivery process can be a very traumatic process, whether it is a natural delivery or a C-section. In many cases the attending doctor needs to twist or turn the baby’s head as it is removed from its mother, so, that could quite easily put a lot of stress on a very delicate nervous system. Chiropractic adjustments for babies and children are gentle, and do not require a lot of pressure. In fact, most adjustments delivered to infants involve just enough pressure to change the shape of a grape. Sometimes, the pressure on the nervous system is what is causing the child’s discomfort, but of course they cannot communicate that. A few chiropractic adjustments is often all that is required to make the little girl or boy more comfortable. Finally, children make ideal chiropractic patients, because they have not yet developed the bad habits that create pain and suffering in adults. They tend to respond better and quicker to chiropractic care compared to adults due to the unburdened status of their nervous system."

        "The popping sound when a chiropractor performs an adjustment is similar to opening a can of soda – basically around every joint in the spine is a sac filled with fluid. Dissolved in that fluid is a gas – nitrogen – which is released when the shape of the joint is changed as in when the chiropractor performs the adjustment. As the gas is released, more of the fluid is pushed into the joint creating a more optimal level of movement within the joint."

        "Chiropractic care is a very effective healthcare method for people suffering with pain in the cervical spine, whether it is recent or acute or chronic (lasting over 6 months). Many patients who come to the clinic with acute cervical issues are usually suffering from muscular pain, or a temporary joint restriction. Chiropractic care can quickly and effectively reduce the amount of pain, improve the range of motion, and reduce the stiffness in the muscle by improving blood flow. Chronic issues such as cervical spondylosis, spondylitis, or other degenerative changes such as disc herniation can be very painful and irritating. In these cases, Chiropractic care can help to re-establish proper joint mechanics, and restore muscle memory by strengthening weak structures, and stretching tight structures. The key to improvement is the ability of the brain to send the correct signal to the body via the nerves, all of which is improved by chiropractic care."

        "Chiropractic care is mostly aimed at nerves, muscles, and bones – or neuromusculoskeletal issues, but it’s also known to improve things that are outside of these common ailments. The number one problem that patients present to my office with is low back pain. Also, neck pain and headaches are common issues. In fact, according to research, chiropractic care is more effective for low back pain, neck pain, and headaches than common medication. The most common reaction I hear after an adjustment is “I feel lighter” – which means people are inherently carrying a load, which can be alleviated by the adjustment. Chiropractic has also been linked to improving breathing, digestion, energy levels, sleep, mood, and even infantile colic. Equine, canine, and feline chiropractors also exist around the world – so basically everybody with a spine and nervous system has something to gain by visiting a chiropractor. As holistic practitioners, chiropractors also open up a lot of options for patients when it comes to non-medical care. Often chiropractors are the “last resorts” for patients who have been recommended surgery, are tired of taking medications, or have had bad experiences with medical treatment. However, chiropractors always receive high marks from patients for patient care, attention to detail, and patient satisfaction."

A nice closed system.

The signal from the body back to the brain is broken, interrupted, or interfered with, resulting in improper response.

In many cases, there is a direct link to the spectrum of mental health issues involving depression, anxiety, and panic. Many chronic pain patients are averse to treatment due to the lengthy nature of their pain. As chiropractors, our goal is to assess, diagnose, and treat the root causes of chronic pain. We can achieve significant improvement by modifying a patient's diet, lifestyle choices, and social activities, along with regular adjustments. Chronic pain takes time to set in, as such, most chronic pain takes longer to improve than acute pain. Chronic pain treatment plans almost always take longer to carry out. Certain cases may require a team approach to healthcare, where a chiropractor refers the patient to another healthcare expert, and together they co-manage the patient’s outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach to healthcare is sometimes the only means for success for a patient’s condition, and chiropractic care is increasingly included in the healthcare process."
